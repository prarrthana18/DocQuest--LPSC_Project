# DocQuest--LPSC_Project
â€œDocQuest: Interactive Document Reader and Q&amp;A Assistant" is an innovative project designed to streamline the process of extracting and retrieving information from multiple PDF documents. The primary objective of DocQuest is to enable users to interactively query a collection of PDFs and receive precise and relevant answers.
This system leverages advanced natural language processing techniques(OCR techniques)  to extract text from PDFs, convert the text into vector representations and store these vectors in a vector database. Upon receiving a query, DocQuest uses sentence embeddings to find the most relevant text snippets from the document collection and generate concise answers. This tool aims to enhance productivity and efficiency by providing quick and accurate responses to user queries, making it an invaluable resource for professionals handling large volumes of textual data.
When evaluating OCR solutions for PDFs, efficiency is determined by factors such as accuracy, ease of integration, support for complex layouts, and processing speed. PyTesseract is a reliable choice for straightforward text extraction due to its balance of accuracy, ease of integration, and extensive language support. It performs well with simple, well-formatted PDFs but may require additional preprocessing for documents with complex layouts.
The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a compact, pre-trained model from the Sentence-Transformers library. It's designed for producing sentence embeddings, capturing the semantic meaning of sentences or texts. Despite its small size, it offers robust performance, making it ideal for applications where resources are limited. In this project, it's used to convert extracted text from PDFs into dense vector embeddings.
ChromaDB offers a user-friendly and cloud-native solution, optimized for quick deployment and moderate scalability. It excels in ease of use, especially for small to medium-sized applications that require seamless integration with common ML models. While it may not match the advanced scalability and search speed of Faiss or the complex querying capabilities of Weaviate, ChromaDB strikes a balance between simplicity and performance. Its strength lies in providing efficient vector storage and retrieval for applications where ease of setup and integration outweigh the need for extreme-scale processing or custom search configurations.
